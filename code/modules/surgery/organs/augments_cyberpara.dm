// Quick to-do list:
// - Orwell-Allans neothalamic system: Yoink Qani-Laaca code, remember to make Trechodrone and other datums
// - Savage knuckleblades: Generic bladed wepon cybernetic
// - Leap balancer: DONE
// - Leap enhancer: Ditto with balancer in terms of how the fuck it'll work, but make it do the same as mining boots with visuals of DNA leap, with wallbonk
// - Cyberear audio recorder: Tape recorder but in your ears that can transfer to normal tape recorder, takes more damage from stuff that cause hearing damage
// - Limited auto-translator: Be able to understand a list of languages, needing to change which one each time, maybe makes you temporarily unable to understand anyone on EMP
// - Neural PDA handler: Internal PDA that you scan your ID to use, unable to use PDA carts, vulnerable to seperating your head from your body in a violent explosion if PDA bombed
